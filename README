ASM6502 - An assembler for 6502 processors

Originally written by Peter Eriksson <pen@lysator.liu.se> around 1987, and
slightly updated for modern compilers around 2015. Parts of the code (evald.c)
written by Anders Furuhed based on an example in the book Advanced C.

All bets are off regarding this code - it was written a long time ago and very
probably is full of bugs and strange assumtions due to the fact that it was
originally created on a Prime/PRIMOS supermini computer and written in pure K&R C.
